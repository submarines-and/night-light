# Night light
I wanted some motion activated lights for when I fetch a tool late at night and I don't want to turn on the lights in my office. Ikea sells led-strips that can be controlled through trådfri, but I figured I could make it myself instead as a fun project.

In my case, an LED filament is used as a light source, but that can of course be substituted.

Project comes with two build configurations in `platformio.ini`, one for debug used directly with an esp8266, the other for prod which is written to the ATTiny. Programmed [using an ESP8266](https://github.com/submarines-and/esp8266-isp).

Split voltage for photo resistor will vary based on which other resistor value is used to ground. If you use other parts, adjust `lightValue` in code so it makes sense.
